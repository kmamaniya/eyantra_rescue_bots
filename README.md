## Safety, Security and Rescue Robot

#### Abstract
<pre><code>Rescue operations are often laborious and dangerous to human life. Thus, we are deploying an Analyzer robot
to access the disaster stuck zone for possible targets/victims. The information collected by this robot
is analysed and a 3D view of the localised is generated at the base station and the pin pointed location
of the target is fed to the rescue robot which is equipped with a mechanical arm to pick up objects.
